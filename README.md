Open source zkSTARKs implementataion. Initial focus should be on highly efficient FRI reduction, with later developement of tools for AIR representation synthesis.

# TODO
- [ ] Decide if it's easier to construct some polynomials "naively" (by plain substitution in coeff form) and wrap those as promises
  - [ ] Z, U for DEEP-ALI
  - [ ] Q polynomials for ALI?
